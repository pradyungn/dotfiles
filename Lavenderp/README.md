# Dotfiles: Lavenderp
My second Arch Linux Rice, and my venture into BSPWM :)

## About
Coming into my second rice, I tried to maintain the dracula aesthetic, but in a different sense. Rather than the full dark aesthetic, I tend to lean towards, with the minimalist
wallpapers, I decided to try a flower wallpaper (thanks mom :P). Suffice to say, I like how it turned out. A couple of major differences are the fact that I'm now on Zathura rather
than Evince, Kitty instead of Termite, and qutebrowser instead of Firefox. I don't regret any of these decisions; they cut down the clutter on my desktop, the usage of my RAM, and
enhance my minimalist aesthetic while maintaining vim-like keybindings and giving me all the features I need from them.
