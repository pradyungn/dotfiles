#+TITLE: Dotfiles: Hades

I thought Hades sounded cool. That's the rice's name now. Deal with it.

My /final/ rice during high school, and my setup as of Spring 2021.

* About
While /Oni/ was a proof-of-concept rice to show off the Mountain colorscheme, test out a new type of bar, and in general embody the "uniform" aesthetic, this rice didn't really have as much planned intent behind it - I just messed around with stuff as I went and uhhhhh yeah here we are.
